# Predicting-Age-from-Microbiome-Data-Benchmarking-Multi-Source-Machine-Learning-Methods

This repository contains the code and resources for my thesis project, which focuses on predicting age using microbiome data through benchmarking various machine learning methods across multiple data sources. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and comparative evaluation of model performance.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Analyze microbiome datasets (relative abundance, marker abundance, and pathway abundance) to predict age.
Benchmark machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and IntegratedLearner method.
Explore the significance and correlation of features with the target variable (age).
Perform descriptive and taxonomic analysis, differential abundance analysis, and model evaluation.

### Repository Structure
Data Preparation.R: Scripts for preprocessing the microbiome datasets, including data cleaning, transformation, and feature selection.
Data Analysis.R: Exploratory and descriptive analysis of the datasets, including statistical summaries and visualization.
Data Modeling.R: Implementation of machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using cross-validation techniques.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the LifeLines DEEP dataset, sourced from the curatedMetagenomicData package.
